# YouTube timestamp extractor 
* The program takes in youtube link and extracts the timestamps embedded in the video
* The program uses web drivers for Edge Browser : https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/?ch=1&cs=3457492030&form=MA13LH
* To use the code you will have to install proper web drivers for your system
* I will implement similar functionality for chrome and firefox further down the line
* To run the UI on your system, Go to the terminal and run `streamlit run .\streamlit_UI.py` to use the UI
